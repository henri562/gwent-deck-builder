# gwent-deck-builder
a JSF project to organize Gwent cards in Witcher 3

This project builds a webapp that allows users to search through Gwent cards
in Witcher 3. The view part of the webapp is implemented with Facelets. The
model part is done with a JSF managed bean component that does the user request
processing and retrieval of data from an Oracle database. The actual card data
is preloaded into the database.

The app is tested on Apache Tomcat.
